It's a website like twitter to add notes . We have a frontend and a backend and locally storing all the posts.
We have used plugins like: react-router-dom for routing and Link for navigating and useNavigate from react-router-dom. 
We have different path to load diff component and using RouterProvider and createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom that creates a object which is used to load elements.
